# IBM Developer Model Asset Exchange: Toxic Comment Classifier

This repository contains code to instantiate and deploy a toxic comment classifier. This model is able to detect 6 types of toxicity in a text fragment. The six detectable types are toxic, severe toxic, obscene, threat, insult, and identity hate.

The model is based on the [pre-trained BERT-Base, English Uncased](https://github.com/google-research/bert/blob/master/README.md) model and was finetuned on the [Toxic Comment Classification Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/jigsaw-toxic-comment-classification-challenge/data) using the [Huggingface BERT Pytorch repository](https://github.com/huggingface/pytorch-pretrained-BERT). The model files are hosted on
[IBM Cloud Object Storage](https://max-cdn.cdn.appdomain.cloud/max-toxic-comment-classifier/1.0.0/assets.tar.gz).
The code in this repository deploys the model as a web service in a Docker container. This repository was developed
as part of the [IBM Developer Model Asset Exchange](https://developer.ibm.com/exchanges/models/) and the public API is powered by [IBM Cloud](https://ibm.biz/Bdz2XM).

A brief definition of the six different toxicity types can be found below.

```
Toxic: very bad, unpleasant, or harmful

Severe toxic: extremely bad and offensive

Obscene: (of the portrayal or description of sexual matters) offensive or disgusting by accepted standards of morality and decency

Threat: a statement of an intention to inflict pain, injury, damage, or other hostile action on someone in retribution for something done or not done

Insult: speak to or treat with disrespect or scornful abuse

Identity hate: hatred, hostility, or violence towards members of a race, ethnicity, nation, religion, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation or any other designated sector of society
```

## Model Metadata
| Domain | Application | Industry  | Framework | Training Data | Input Data |
| --------- | --------  | -------- | --------- | --------- | --------------- |

## Benchmark

This model achieves a column-wise ROC AUC score of 0.98355 (private score) in the [Kaggle Toxic Comment Classification Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/jigsaw-toxic-comment-classification-challenge). This implementation is trained with a maximum sequence length of 256 instead of 512 to have higher inference speed. For most applications outside of this Kaggle competition, a sequence length of 256 is more than sufficient.

## Pre-requisites:
* `docker`: The [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) command-line interface. Follow the [installation instructions](https://docs.docker.com/install/) for your system.
* The minimum recommended resources for this model is 4GB Memory and 4 CPUs.

# Deployment options

* [Deploy from Docker Hub](#deploy-from-docker-hub)
* [Deploy on Red Hat OpenShift](#deploy-on-red-hat-openshift)
* [Deploy on Kubernetes](#deploy-on-kubernetes)
* [Run Locally](#run-locally)

## Deploy from Docker Hub
To run the docker image, which automatically starts the model serving API, run:

```
$ docker run -it -p 5000:5000 codait/max-toxic-comment-classifier
```

This will pull a pre-built image from Docker Hub (or use an existing image if already cached locally) and run it.
If you'd rather checkout and build the model locally you can follow the [run locally](#run-locally) steps below.

## Deploy on Red Hat OpenShift

You can deploy the model-serving microservice on Red Hat OpenShift by following the instructions for the OpenShift web console or the OpenShift Container Platform CLI [in this tutorial](https://developer.ibm.com/tutorials/deploy-a-model-asset-exchange-microservice-on-red-hat-openshift/), specifying `codait/max-toxic-comment-classifier` as the image name.

## Deploy on Kubernetes
You can also deploy the model on Kubernetes using the latest docker image on Docker Hub.

On your Kubernetes cluster, run the following commands:

```
$ kubectl apply -f https://github.com/IBM/MAX-Toxic-Comment-Classifier/raw/master/max-toxic-comment-classifier.yaml
```

The model will be available internally at port `5000`, but can also be accessed externally through the `NodePort`.

A more elaborate tutorial on how to deploy this MAX model to production on [IBM Cloud](https://ibm.biz/Bdz2XM) can be found [here](http://ibm.biz/max-to-ibm-cloud-tutorial).

## Run Locally
1. [Build the Model](#1-build-the-model)
2. [Deploy the Model](#2-deploy-the-model)
3. [Use the Model](#3-use-the-model)
4. [Development](#4-development)
5. [Cleanup](#5-cleanup)


### 1. Build the Model
Clone this repository locally. In a terminal, run the following command:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/IBM/MAX-Toxic-Comment-Classifier.git
```

Change directory into the repository base folder:

```
$ cd MAX-Toxic-Comment-Classifier
```

To build the docker image locally, run: 

```
$ docker build -t max-toxic-comment-classifier .
```

All required model assets will be downloaded during the build process. _Note_ that currently this docker image is CPU only (we will add support for GPU images later).


### 2. Deploy the Model
To run the docker image, which automatically starts the model serving API, run:

```
$ docker run -it -p 5000:5000 max-toxic-comment-classifier
```

### 3. Use the Model

The API server automatically generates an interactive Swagger documentation page. Go to `http://localhost:5000` to load it. From there you can explore the API and also create test requests.

```json
Example:
{
  "text": [
    "I would like to punch you.",
    "In hindsight, I do apologize for my previous statement."
  ]
}

Result:
{
  "status": "ok",
  "results": [
    {
      "original_text": "I would like to punch you.",
      "predictions": {
        "toxic": 0.9796434044837952,
        "severe_toxic": 0.07256634533405304,
        "obscene": 0.058431386947631836,
        "threat": 0.8635178804397583,
        "insult": 0.11121545732021332,
        "identity_hate": 0.013826466165482998
      }
    },
    {
      "original_text": "In hindsight, I do apologize for my previous statement.",
      "predictions": {
        "toxic": 0.00029103411361575127,
        "severe_toxic": 0.00012417171092238277,
        "obscene": 0.0001522742968518287,
        "threat": 8.440738747594878e-05,
        "insult": 0.00016013211279641837,
        "identity_hate": 0.00012860879360232502
      }
    }
  ]
}
```


Use the ```model/predict``` endpoint to submit input text in json format. The JSON structure should have one key, ```text```, with as value a list of input strings to be analyzed. An example can be found in the image below.

Submitting proper json data triggers the model and will return a json file with a ```status``` and a ```predictions``` key. With this ```predictions``` field, a list of class labels and their corresponding probabilities will be associated. The first element in the list corresponds to the prediction for the first string in the input list.


![Swagger UI Screenshot](docs/swagger-screenshot.png)

You can also test it on the command line, for example:

```bash
$ curl -d "{ \"text\": [ \"I would like to punch you.\", \"In hindsight, I do apologize for my previous statement.\" ]}" -X POST "http://localhost:5000/model/predict" -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

You should see a JSON response like that below:

```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "results": [
    {
      "original_text": "I would like to punch you.",
      "predictions": {
        "toxic": 0.9796434044837952,
        "severe_toxic": 0.07256634533405304,
        "obscene": 0.058431386947631836,
        "threat": 0.8635178804397583,
        "insult": 0.11121545732021332,
        "identity_hate": 0.013826466165482998
      }
    },
    {
      "original_text": "In hindsight, I do apologize for my previous statement.",
      "predictions": {
        "toxic": 0.00029103411361575127,
        "severe_toxic": 0.00012417171092238277,
        "obscene": 0.0001522742968518287,
        "threat": 8.440738747594878e-05,
        "insult": 0.00016013211279641837,
        "identity_hate": 0.00012860879360232502
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### 4. Development
To run the Flask API app in debug mode, edit `config.py` to set `DEBUG = True` under the application settings. You will then need to rebuild the docker image (see [step 1](#1-build-the-model)).

### 5. Cleanup
To stop the Docker container, type `CTRL` + `C` in your terminal.
