thank you. there's now also the new development that somebody found recent ips that clearly belong to the sockmaster. a previous cu came out as inconclusive because the sockmaster account itself was stale but with this additional data a new cu checking the sock account against the known ips might be worth it. do you think it would be possible to request one,0,0,0,0,0,0

ok now i found the part about her in the alf section. my opinion influenced a lot by the recent discussions of blp and of the insulin matter i think that we should treat both of them the same way no matter what we do because it would be pov to treat the two of them differently. and i would come down on the side of not naming either one of them by name. i don't think it adds anything in either case to provide the name and i think that both instances are of marginal justification to name names in part per wp perp. my suggestion would be in both cases just to refer to them as an employee of the respective organization.,0,0,0,0,0,0

source says and musa al- alami surmised that the mufti would agree to partition if he were promised that he would rule the arab state. the key word here is surmised which indicates that alami was making a conjecture not reporting something he knew. ykantor's misreporting of this which nmmng somehow failed to notice is shameful. looking at cohen's source a book of khalaf that seems quite good we find that this is an assertion made by alami in a secret meeting with a british representative in which alami made clear that he detested husseini. khalaf remarks although the mufti most certainly had the ambition to be the supreme leader of the the arabs of palestine there is neither evidence nor indications to substantiate alami's claim that the mufti would have under any circumstances accepted partition. i don't think any of this belongs here there are enough facts to fill out this page without adding conjectures made by political opponents.,0,0,0,0,0,0
las vegas vs. las vegas valley i understand your point about las vegas being used very generally as someone who has lived in both pittsburgh actually allison park pennsylvania and los angeles actually orange california i can certainly sympathize. however if there is no evidence that a given person or group is from a differently named area henderson enterprise etc and their official pages list their home as las vegas it makes little sense not to take them at their word. unless you can provide definitive evidence that someone is not from las vegas proper and they report that they are please do not change links to state they are from the las vegas valley . -,0,0,0,0,0,0

fair use rationale for image detours.jpg thanks for uploading or contributing to image detours.jpg. i notice the image page specifies that the image is being used under fair use but there is no explanation or rationale as to why its use in wikipedia articles constitutes fair use. in addition to the boilerplate fair use template you must also write out on the image description page a specific explanation or rationale for why using this image in each article is consistent with fair use. suggestions on how to do so can be found here. please go to the image description page and edit it to include a fair use rationale. using one of the templates at wikipedia fair use rationale guideline is an easy way to ensure that your image is in compliance with wikipedia policy but remember that you must complete the template. do not simply insert a blank template on an image page. if you have uploaded other fair use media consider checking that you have specified the fair use rationale on those pages too. you can find a list of 'image' pages you have edited by clicking on the link it is located at the very top of any wikipedia page when you are logged in and then selecting image from the dropdown box. note that any non-free media lacking such an explanation will be deleted one week after they have been uploaded as described on criteria for speedy deletion. if you have any questions please ask them at the media copyright questions page. thank you.,0,0,0,0,0,0

my defamation on the diyab article alright i understand. i wonder however if you also screen for the painful bias presented all throughout the diyab article. this piece makes love to diyab instead of presenting an objective account of her. it is disgusting particularly because this love-making is in flagrant contradiction with the woman's actual merits which are almost nonexistent. just recently she made a complete fool of herself on the bbc one by announcing that all syrians are better of in their war-torn nation instead of seeking a better chance at life she also contradicts herself too many times and is a disgrace to all people of the levant. of course denying innocent people the support they need does not apply to her because she is educated unlike the barbarians that are going to flood into england. i am not syrian nor am in any way affected by the topic she was addressing but to laud someone like this even on a wiki page is not right. nadithreigns,0,0,0,0,0,0
