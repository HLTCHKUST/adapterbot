        "thank you. there's now also the new development that somebody found recent ips that clearly belong to the sockmaster. a previous cu came out as inconclusive because the sockmaster account itself was stale but with this additional data a new cu checking the sock account against the known ips might be worth it. do you think it would be possible to request one",
        "what on earth is going on here why has some new user steamed in removed the extensive page on manchester redirected it to greater manchester and taken the manchester page to city of manchester what a fucking mess.",
        "ok now i found the part about her in the alf section. my opinion influenced a lot by the recent discussions of blp and of the insulin matter i think that we should treat both of them the same way no matter what we do because it would be pov to treat the two of them differently. and i would come down on the side of not naming either one of them by name. i don't think it adds anything in either case to provide the name and i think that both instances are of marginal justification to name names in part per wp perp. my suggestion would be in both cases just to refer to them as an employee of the respective organization.",
        "and i almost forgot i'm a gay i like sucking black dicks or balls or whatsoever",
        "reports okay i did not report you only the anon guy. also you did call me flat out stupid. i never made any reference to your person. give me one example where i said you were stupid or that italians are stupid. i did inslut you nor did i insult italians. i just don't beleive that italy is a great power. we have to agree to disagree. things however got out of hand and actions neeeded to be taken. regards",
        "source says and musa al- alami surmised that the mufti would agree to partition if he were promised that he would rule the arab state. the key word here is surmised which indicates that alami was making a conjecture not reporting something he knew. ykantor's misreporting of this which nmmng somehow failed to notice is shameful. looking at cohen's source a book of khalaf that seems quite good we find that this is an assertion made by alami in a secret meeting with a british representative in which alami made clear that he detested husseini. khalaf remarks although the mufti most certainly had the ambition to be the supreme leader of the the arabs of palestine there is neither evidence nor indications to substantiate alami's claim that the mufti would have under any circumstances accepted partition. i don't think any of this belongs here there are enough facts to fill out this page without adding conjectures made by political opponents.",
        "las vegas vs. las vegas valley i understand your point about las vegas being used very generally as someone who has lived in both pittsburgh actually allison park pennsylvania and los angeles actually orange california i can certainly sympathize. however if there is no evidence that a given person or group is from a differently named area henderson enterprise etc and their official pages list their home as las vegas it makes little sense not to take them at their word. unless you can provide definitive evidence that someone is not from las vegas proper and they report that they are please do not change links to state they are from the las vegas valley . -",
        "gds is the sit and will beat the shit out of any blood vice lords and ltin kings that sow thier face to any gd area. and by the way we rollin with the crips too. yall faggeds dont want it with the six point star.",
        "cleanup this article needs to be cleaned up a bit and given some more details. i'll do what i can.",
